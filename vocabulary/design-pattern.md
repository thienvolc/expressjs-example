## **Design Pattern Vocabulary**

### **Creational Patterns**

- **create**: Instantiate a new object or resource.
- **build**: Construct an object with specific components or properties.
- **initialize**: Set up an object with necessary values or state.
- **prototype**: Create a new instance by copying an existing one.
- **singleton**: Ensure only one instance of a class exists throughout the application.

### **Structural Patterns**

- **compose**: Combine objects to form a larger, more complex structure.
- **delegate**: Pass responsibility for an action to another object.
- **adapt**: Change the interface of a class to meet client expectations.
- **facade**: Provide a simplified interface for a complex system.
- **proxy**: Control access to an object by acting as an intermediary.

### **Behavioral Patterns**

- **observe**: Track changes in an object’s state and respond accordingly.
- **command**: Encapsulate a request or action as an object.
- **strategy**: Define a family of algorithms and let the client choose which to use.
- **template**: Define a structure for an algorithm, but allow customization in subclasses.
- **state**: Change behavior based on an object’s internal state.
- **mediator**: Simplify communication between objects by using an intermediary.
- **chain**: Pass requests through a chain of handlers, each processing part of the request.
- **memento**: Capture and restore an object’s state without exposing its internal structure.
- **iterator**: Provide a way to access elements of a collection sequentially.
- **visitor**: Perform operations on elements without modifying their classes.
